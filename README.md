### 1. Introduction

**heybot** is my best friend on my daily development activities. It's designed to help developers on their day-to-day development activities. It eases *some* chore development activities and improves your productivity. *It's worth trying it.*

Happy coding! :coffee:

### 2. Requirements

**heybot** is mainly designed to work in

- **Subversion**
- **Redmine**
- **Slack**

environment. If you use [redmine](http://www.redmine.org/) as project management/issue tracking application, [subversion](https://subversion.apache.org/) as version control system and [slack](https://slack.com/) and *conventional* e-mail as communication environment then **heybot** can help you.

For other ecosystems, you can fork the project or contribute directly to this project. All feedbacks and [contributions](https://github.com/csonuryilmaz/heybot/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome. Source code is a java project which is developed in Netbeans IDE.

### 3. Installation

Heybot is tested and works on Mac OS X and Gnu/Linux distributions. Java 1.8+ (jre/jdk) have to be installed before **heybot**. You can check whether it's installed and version is sufficient by

```bash
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_65"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_65-b17)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.65-b01, mixed mode)
```

After handling Java dependency, simply;

- download latest version of **heybot** from [latest release](https://github.com/csonuryilmaz/heybot/releases/latest)
- extract archive
- execute installtion script

```bash
wget https://github.com/csonuryilmaz/heybot/releases/download/1.31.0.3/heybot-1.31.0.3.tar.gz
tar -zxvf heybot-1.31.0.3.tar.gz
cd heybot-1.31.0.3
chmod a+x install.sh
./install.sh
```

Above command will downlod **heybot** archive into current directory.

In order to download into different directory, for example `~/Downloads`

```bash
wget https://github.com/csonuryilmaz/heybot/releases/download/1.31.0.3/heybot-1.31.0.3.tar.gz -P ~/Downloads
tar -zxvf ~/Downloads/heybot-1.31.0.3.tar.gz
chmod a+x heybot-1.31.0.3/install.sh
heybot-1.31.0.3/install.sh
```

It will ask for sudo permission at installation process, so your user should be a sudoer. (Or maybe you can run installation script as root, but it's not recommended.)
If everything is okay, you should see (ascii) logo and version information when you execute

```bash
$ heybot -v
  _           _       _
 | |_ ___ _ _| |_ ___| |_
 |   | -_| | | . | . |  _|
 |_|_|___|_  |___|___|_|

### 4. Usage

It's very easy to use **heybot** and its call syntax is like commanding a bot. It's as easy as saying this

```bash
heybot -do something.hb
```

Also you can shorten command like

```bash
heybot something
```

This is the main syntax and now you've learned most of it. You write details into a configuration file with extension **.hb**. Then you say to **heybot**

> Hey bot! Do my job (operation) which is defined in the file I gave.

For example; I want to begin a redmine issue with creating a branch and checking it out to my workspace, I call this

```bash
heybot -do begin-issue-1293.hb
```

or shortly

```bash
heybot begin-issue-1293
```

In [templates](https://github.com/csonuryilmaz/heybot/tree/master/heybot/templates) folder you can find example **.hb** templates for each operation. You can copy them, and define your own operation by filling parameters.

Let's dive into some details and explain them with examples.

### 5. Operations

Below there is a list of operations that you can use with heybot.

#### 5.1. Begin-Issue

It's used when starting to develop a Redmine issue. It creates a new branch from trunk, downloads Subversion branch into local disk, updates issue status and triggers your IDE to begin working.

Required parameters:

- REDMINE_URL= Redmine API url. (most of the time this is root url of your redmine installation)
- REDMINE_TOKEN= Redmine API access key taken from [my account page](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineAccounts).
- ISSUE= Redmine issue number which will be developed. (integer)
- REPOSITORY_PATH= Subversion repository path. (Most of the time `Repository Root` field when `svn info` is executed on local working copy.)
- TRUNK_PATH= Subversion (project) trunk folder, which is defined **relative** to `Repository Root`.
- BRANCHES_PATH= Subversion branches folder, which is defined **relative** to `Repository Root`.

Optional parameters:

- ASSIGNEE_ID= Redmine `user_id` which identifies Redmine user. (After you logged in Redmine, click on your username on the left-hand side to open your activity page. Redmine `user_id` is the number at the end of the URL. For example, if URL is `http://kyrepo-apps.sourcerepo.com/redmine/kyrepo/users/5` then `5` is your Redmine `user_id`.)
  - **Note:** If you use this parameter, heybot will check whether you're `ASSIGNEE` of the given `ISSUE`. So it'll prevent you from mistakenly begining another developer's issue.
- BEGAN_STATUS= Redmine issue status which will be updated to. For example, `in progress` for a started issue.
- WORKSPACE_PATH= If not empty, heybot will download created branch into your local disk. Equivalent to `svn checkout` of your branch.
- IDE_PATH= If not empty, heybot will trigger IDE with downloaded project folder. So you can start working immediately. Parameter is used in two ways
  - When only IDE executable path is given, it will append project folder at the end of the parameter and run. Example;
    - `/home/onur/netbeans-8.2/bin/netbeans`
  - When a command is given with an insertion mask about project folder (`%s` syntax is used), it will replace `%s` with project folder and run. Example;
    - `open %s/Kitapyurdu.xcodeproj/`
- REFRESH_IF_EXISTS= While creating new branch from trunk, if branch exists normally heybot will do nothing and continue to other steps. (checkout, issue status update vs.) But if you want to refresh branch and create a new one at repository although it exists, then give `true` value for this parameter. This is an exceptional case and most of the its value will be `false`.
- CACHE_ENABLED= Heybot uses cache internally to optimize checkout process. I strongly recommend this option to be `true` for faster beginning of issus. Otherwise it'll always fresh checkout project; depending on your internet speed and projectg size it may be a slow process.
- SWITCH_FROM_ISSUE= Also there is another option to speed up checkout process when you don't use `CACHE_ENABLED`. If you have completed development of some issues and you don't need them in the future; by giving its number as value, heybot will convert it into new `ISSUE` so you will save up from local disk space and also it'll be a faster checkout because of `svn switch`.
- CHECKOUT_IF_SWITCH_FAILS= If switching from an existing issue fails in someway, and you don't want the checkout process to be broken, setting it `true` will checkout project folder in traditional, slower way.

If you want to execute some command at the end of begin issue process below use below **optional** parameters for SSH credentials and executable.

- REMOTE_HOST= Hostname or IP of remote machine which has an eligible SSH access with username and password.
- REMOTE_USER= SSH user's username.
- REMOTE_PASS= SSH user's password.
- REMOTE_PORT= If empty, default 22 is assumed. Enter integer value if server has custom port for SSH connections.
- REMOTE_EXEC= Enter any bash command here. It may be a simple executable bash file or a combination of piped commands. Internally when heybot connected to host by SSH, working directory is user's home directory. For example; `/home/onur/` So for successful execution, test your command and be sure it's working on remote host's user home directory. Then it'll work in heybot without any problem. If entered command contains **$issue** keyword, all occurences will be replaced with the value of **ISSUE** parameter.

Example:

```properties
# File: begin-i3436.hb

OPERATION=begin-issue

# ************
# * required *
# ************

# credentials (redmine)
REDMINE_URL=https://test-apps.sourcerepo.com/redmine/test

Required parameters:

- HOST= IP or hostnames of remote server(s) to connect. (Comma seperated multiple servers are accepted.)
- USERNAME= Username to login remote server.
- PASSWORD= Password to login remote server.
- REMOTE_PATH= Remote working directory to send changes.

Optional parameters:

- SOURCE_PATH= Local working directory to take changes from. If not given or empty, **current working directory** (where heybot command is triggered) is assumed. (`pwd`)

# optional parameters
LIMIT=10

```

#### 5.4. Cleanup-Svn

:no_entry_sign: :memo: @todo Will be reviewed and updated!

It deletes issues which is *closed*,*deployed* or any status you defined, from subversion branches path. By deleting passive branches it removes some garbage from your subversion. It is meaningful when you use *one issue is resolved in one branch* paradigm.

Required parameters:

- BRANCH_PATH= Subversion branch path that you keep your branches.
- STATUS= Status/Statuses to check for cleanup operation.(comma seperated)
- REDMINE_TOKEN= Redmine API access key taken from [my account page](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineAccounts).

LIMIT=10

```

#### 5.5. Review

:no_entry_sign: :memo: @todo Will be reviewed and updated!

It updates the status of issue as *testing*, *in review* or anything you defined in your redmine configuration. Then tries to merge changes from an issue to an existing working copy. (most of the time, existing working copy is trunk) It preemptively postpones any conflicts for later resolution.

Required Parameters:

- ISSUE= Issue number(or ID) to review. (merge from)
- ISSUE_STATUS_TO_UPDATE= Issue status will be updated to defined parameter, which indicates the operation done.
- SUBVERSION_PATH= Branch subversion directory where all branches are kept.
- REDMINE_TOKEN= Redmine API access key taken from [my account page](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineAccounts).
- REDMINE_URL= Redmine API url. (most of the time this is root url of your redmine installation)

Optional parameters:

- SOURCE_PATH= Existing working copy to make changes. (merge to) If not given or empty, *current working directory* is assumed. (pwd)
- ISSUE_STATUS_SHOULD_BE= The status of issue that can be reviewed and eligible to test. If issue status is not equals to this parameter, operation won't begin.

Example:

```properties
# File: review_issue.hb

ISSUE_STATUS_SHOULD_BE=Resolved

```

#### 5.6. Check-New

:no_entry_sign: :memo: @todo Will be reviewed and updated!

It checks whether *redmine* has new issues with given status(optional) and sends a notification message to defined *slack* channel/user. (Post to channel configuration is done from slack panel. Please, check out below notes.) For example; you can get notifications about newly added issues from a redmine project.

Required Parameters:

- PROJECT= Project name to follow new issues.
- REDMINE_TOKEN= Redmine API access key taken from [my account page](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineAccounts).
- REDMINE_URL= Redmine API url. (most of the time this is root url of your redmine installation)
- WEBHOOK_URL= Slack incoming webhook to send notifications.

Optional Parameters:

- ISSUE_STATUS= Check status of newly added issue with this defined value. If empty, there will be no status check.

Internal Parameters:

- LAST_ISSUE= Last issue number that has been notified about. (This parameter will be modified by *heybot* after each execution.) If doesn't have value, 0 assumed.
- LAST_CREATED_ON= Last notified issue's created timestamp. (This parameter will be modified by *heybot* after each execution.) When last notified issue is deleted or unreachable this timestamp is used to filter new issues.

Example:

```properties
# File: check_new_issue.hb

# operation
OPERATION=check-new

# required parameters
PROJECT=support
REDMINE_TOKEN=abab3a53c34f66b92fg5cdcbb3bb95a3c78d862e
REDMINE_URL=https://test-apps.sourcerepo.com/redmine/test
WEBHOOK_URL=https://hooks.slack.com/services/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

# optional parameters
ISSUE_STATUS=New

# internal parameters
LAST_ISSUE=892
LAST_CREATED_ON=2017-04-03 11\:40\:10

```

Also you can schedule this operation with a crontab entry. For example, below entry will check new issues at 5 minutes interval;

```bash
*/5 * * * * /usr/local/bin/heybot -d check_new.hb 1> /dev/null 2> /var/www/html/heybot.log
```

#### 5.7. Sync-Issue

:no_entry_sign: :memo: @todo Will be reviewed and updated!

In our software development life cycle, we have a redmine project which is used like a _ticket system_ for our customers. When they discover a bug or need a revision, they open a new issue on that redmine project. Let's name it **support** project. All those issues on **support** project are physically related to development issues which reside in our internal development projects. Although life-cycle of a typical development issue is very detailed, life-cycle of a typical **support** issue is very simple: New -> In Progress -> Closed. (Sometimes it can have this cycle when it's paused for some time: In Progress -> On Hold -> In Progress) These states are enough for customers to track their issues roughly. When they need to see the details, they can open an issue and look at detailed statuses of related issues just in a minute.

Although we manage and update statuses of issues at our internal development projects very often in order to track our internal process, we don't have any time to sync state of internal issues to their related **support** issues. This process contains not only syncing statuses but also adding internal issues' assignees as watchers to support issues and updating start dates, end dates of support issues from internal issues correctly. Why adding assignee as watcher? Because developer, who's working with internal issue, should get latest changes and notifications from its related support issue in order to get things done correctly and on time. Why updating start and end dates? Because most of the issues aren't handled as soon as it's opened. They wait in queue for days and sometimes weeks before they are handled.

This operation is built to help us manage this mechanical process. Goal is to automatically manage status, assignee-watcher, start date and end date of an **support** issue by processing its related internal or development issues.

Required Parameters:

- SUPPORT_PROJECT= Support or ticket project name which is used by customers. (N)
- SUPPORT_NEW_STATUS= Support status which is corresponding to **new** status.
- SUPPORT_IN_PROGRESS_STATUS= Support status which is corresponding to **in progress** status.
- SUPPORT_ON_HOLD_STATUS= Support status which is corresponding to **on hold** status.
- SUPPORT_CLOSED_STATUS= Support status which is corresponding to **closed** status.
- SUPPORT_SYNC_START_DATE= Modify support issue start date from internal issues. (new -> *) **true** || **false**
- SUPPORT_SYNC_DUE_DATE= Modify support issue due date from internal issues. (* -> closed) **true** || **false**
- INTERNAL_PROJECT= Internal development projects which are used by your team. (N)
- INTERNAL_NEW_STATUS= Internal statuses which are corresponding to **new** status of SUPPORT. (N)
- INTERNAL_IN_PROGRESS_STATUS=  Internal statuses which are corresponding to **in progress** status of SUPPORT. (N)
- INTERNAL_ON_HOLD_STATUS= Internal statuses which are corresponding to **on hold** status of SUPPORT. (N)
- INTERNAL_CLOSED_STATUS= Internal statuses which are corresponding to **closed** status of SUPPORT. (N)
- SUPPORT_WATCHER= Internal issue fields to check as support issue watcher. (N)
- REDMINE_TOKEN= Redmine API access key taken from [my account page](http://www.redmine.org/projects/redmine/wiki/RedmineAccounts).
- REDMINE_URL= Redmine API url. (most of the time this is root url of your redmine installation)

Internal Parameters:

- LAST_CHECK_TIME= Last execution time of this operation. (This parameter will be modified by *heybot* after each execution. It's designed to improve efficiency of the operation. It will process changes from last execution time. So you can execute the operation very often, in short durations. If empty, current timestamp will be set as last check time.)

Notes:

- **(N)** If there are more than one value to enter, you can write all of them as comma-separated values. Please check examples.
- **NEW** In order to update *support* issue as *new* status, **all** of the related *internal* issues must be in *new* status.
- **IN_PROGRESS** In order to update *support* issue as *in progress* status **one** of the related *internal* issues is enough to be in *in progress* status.
- **ON_HOLD** In order to update *support* issue as *on hold* status **one** of the related *internal* issues is enough to be in *on hold* status.
- **CLOSED** In order to update *support* issue as *closed* status, **all** of the related *internal* issues must be in *closed* status.
- It detects **start date** from *in progress* status logs of related internal issues. Minimum internal *in progress* date will set as start date of support issue.
- It detects **due date** from *closed* status logs of related internal issues. Maximum internal *closed* date will set as due date of support issue.
- It maintains watchers of support issues automatically. First detects all watcher candidates from internal issues defined by SUPPORT_WATCHER fields. Then compares them with support issue watchers. After comparison it adds or deletes watchers.
- Some updates on issues (for example, adding a relation to an issue) don't update issue's **updated on** timestamp. In this case, heybot sync-issue operation won't catch the updated issue. This situation totally comes from redmine design, so it's not a bug. [(details)](https://github.com/csonuryilmaz/projects/issues/19)

#### 5.8. Next-Version

:no_entry_sign: :memo: @todo Will be reviewed and updated!

It enables you to maintain your new release or version of software easily, with friction free. It orchestrates redmine *version*, its related *issues* and your *codebase*. Very briefly, when you're ready to release a new version of your software;

- checks waiting issues ready to relase
- closes old version
- computes new version number (like [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/))
- creates a new version
- assigns new version to your waiting issues
- updates your codebase with new version number
- creates subversion tag for new release

Here are some general notes that can help you in various ways.

#### 6.1. How to obtain slack incoming webhook URL

Go to yourteam.slack.com/apps/build/custom-integration and click on *Incoming Webhooks*, then select a channel or user you want to post your messages to.

Once done, youâll see your incoming webhook integrationâs configuration page.

Scroll down and thereâll be a Webhook URL in the format `https://hooks.slack.com/services/TXXXXXXXX/BXXXXXXXX/token`. Save that URL somewhere, weâll need it later. You can further change the icon and name of the integration in this page itself.
