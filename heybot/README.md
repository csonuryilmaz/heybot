# heybot

###### Purpose:

	**heybot** is my best friend on my daily development activities. It's designed to help developers on their day-to-day development activities. It eases *some* chore development activities and improves your productivity. *It's worth trying it.*

###### Usage:

	It's very easy to use **heybot** and its call syntax is like commanding a bot. It's as easy as saying this: *heybot -do something.hb* This is the main syntax and now you've learned most of it. You write details into a file with extension *hb*. Then you say to **heybot**:
	
> Hey bot! Do my job which is defined in the file I gave.
	
	For example; I want to begin a redmine issue with creating a branch and checking it out to my workspace, I call this:
	
```
$ heybot -do begin_issue.hb
```

	Let's dive into some details and explain them with examples. Below there is a list of operations that you can use with heybot.
	
**1. Upload** 

	*todo*
	
**2. Cleanup**

	*todo*
	
**3. Deploy**

	*todo*
