This folder contains **heybot** stable and downloadable releases. I haven't kept any changelogs yet. So changes between versions are hard to track. So if you are new to **heybot**, I suggest you to download and use latest version. Latest version is always the best version :) 

I have adopted document driven development. I first write down changes, revisions, new features into documentation and then  begin to develop. So I can say that documentation is always aligned with the latest version.
